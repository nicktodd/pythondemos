# Exercise 1: Functions as First-Class Citizens

# TODO: Implement apply_operation
def apply_operation(func, x, y):
    pass

# TODO: Implement create_multiplier
def create_multiplier(factor):
    pass

# TODO: Create a list of functions and apply them to a value

# TODO: Store functions in a dictionary and call them by key

# Test code (uncomment to test)
# result = apply_operation(lambda x, y: x + y, 3, 4)
# print(result)  # Should print 7

# double = create_multiplier(2)
# print(double(5))  # Should print 10

# funcs = [lambda x: x**2, lambda x: x*2, lambda x: x+10]
# results = [f(3) for f in funcs]
# print(results)  # Should print [9, 6, 13]
