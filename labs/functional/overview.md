# Functional Programming Lab

This folder contains starter files for the Python Functional Programming lab.

## Files

- `first_class_functions.py` - Starter for functions as first-class citizens
- `lambda_exercises.py` - Starter for lambda functions
- `map_filter_reduce_exercises.py` - Starter for map, filter, reduce
- `comprehensions_exercises.py` - Starter for list comprehensions
- `generator_exercises.py` - Starter for generators
- `recursion_exercises.py` - Starter for recursion
- `pure_functions_exercises.py` - Starter for pure functions
- `decorator_exercises.py` - Starter for decorators

## Instructions

1. Read the lab instructions in `lab_instructions/functional.md`
2. Start with `first_class_functions.py` and implement the required functionality
3. Uncomment and run the test code at the bottom of each file
4. Move to the next file once the current one is working
5. Compare your solutions with the completed versions in `solutions/functional/`

## Tips

- Each file builds on the concepts from the previous ones
- Use the demo files in `demos/functional/` as references
- Test frequently as you implement each function
- Remember that functional programming emphasizes immutability and pure functions
