# Classes Lab

This folder contains starter files for the Python Classes and Objects lab.

## Files

- `basic_account.py` - Starter for basic BankAccount class

- `account_strings.py` - Starter for string representations
- `savings_account.py` - Starter for inheritance (SavingsAccount)
- `premium_account.py` - Starter for multiple inheritance (PremiumAccount)

## Instructions

1. Read the lab instructions in `lab_instructions/classes.md`
2. Start with `basic_account.py` and implement the required functionality
3. Uncomment and run the test code at the bottom of each file
4. Move to the next file once the current one is working
5. Compare your solutions with the completed versions in `solutions/classes/`

## Tips

- Each file builds on the concepts from the previous ones
- Use the demo files in `demos/classes_and_objects/` as references
- Test frequently as you implement each method
- Don't forget to handle edge cases (negative amounts, insufficient funds, etc.)
