This folder contains starter files for the Python Exception Handling lab.

## Files

- `best_practices.py` - Starter for best practices

## Instructions

1. Read the lab instructions in `lab_instructions/exception_handling.md`
2. Start with `basic_exception_handling.py` and implement the required functionality
3. Uncomment and run the test code at the bottom of each file
4. Move to the next file once the current one is working
5. Compare your solutions with the completed versions in `solutions/exception_handling/`

## Tips

- Each file builds on the concepts from the previous ones
- Use the demo files in `demos/exception_handling/` as references
- Test frequently as you implement each function
- Remember that good exception handling is about failing gracefully
