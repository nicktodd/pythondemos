# Testing and Mocking Lab

This directory contains starter files for the Python Testing and Mocking lab. The lab covers comprehensive unit testing and mocking techniques using pytest and pyhamcrest.

## Lab Exercises

1. **calculator_tests.py** - Basic pytest usage with a Calculator class
2. **user_service_tests.py** - Pytest fixtures for user management testing
3. **validation_tests.py** - Parametrized tests for data validation
4. **api_client_tests.py** - Mocking external API dependencies
5. **hamcrest_assertions.py** - Expressive assertions with pyhamcrest
6. **async_service_tests.py** - Testing asynchronous code with pytest-asyncio
7. **ecommerce_integration.py** - Integration testing for e-commerce system
8. **best_practices_example.py** - Testing best practices and organization

## Getting Started

1. Review the demo files in `../../demos/testing_and_mock/` to understand the concepts
2. Read the lab instructions in `../../lab_instructions/testing_and_mock.md`
3. Complete each exercise by implementing the TODO items in the starter files
4. Run tests with `pytest <filename>.py -v`

## Requirements

```bash
pip install pytest pyhamcrest pytest-asyncio requests
```

## Solutions

After completing the exercises, check your implementations against the solutions in `../../solutions/testing_and_mock/`.

- Write comprehensive unit tests with pytest
- Use fixtures for test setup and teardown
- Create parametrized tests for multiple scenarios
- Mock external dependencies effectively
- Write expressive assertions with hamcrest
- Test asynchronous code
- Implement integration tests
- Apply testing best practices
