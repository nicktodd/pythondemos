# Data Typing Labs

This directory contains starter files for the Python Data Typing Lab. Each file corresponds to an exercise in the lab instructions.

## Files

- `basic_type_hints.py` - Basic type hints for variables and functions
- `collections_typing.py` - Type hints with collections (List, Dict, Tuple, Set)
- `optional_union.py` - Optional and Union types for flexibility
- `custom_types.py` - Custom types, type aliases, and advanced structures
- `advanced_typing.py` - Generics, protocols, and type variables
- `type_checking.py` - Runtime type checking and validation
- `best_practices.py` - Best practices for effective type hinting
- `integration_project.py` - Comprehensive integration project

## Instructions

1. Read the corresponding section in `lab_instructions/data_typing.md`
2. Complete the TODO sections in each file
3. Test your implementations with the provided test cases
4. Compare your solutions with the completed versions in `../solutions/data_typing/`

## Tips

- Start with `basic_type_hints.py` and progress through the files
- Use the demo files in `../../demos/data_typing/` as references
- Test frequently as you implement each function
- Run `mypy` on your completed files for static type checking

## Running Tests

You can run individual files:

```bash
python basic_type_hints.py
```

Or use mypy for type checking:

```bash
mypy basic_type_hints.py
```
