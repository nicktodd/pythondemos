				"* The accumulated value so far (defaults to 0 on the first call)\n",

				"* Finally call sortBy() to sort the (word, count) tuples by descending word count.\n",

				"1. Reading data from a CSV file into a DataFrame\n",
				"2. Specifying options when reading a file\n",
				"3. Defining a schema for the data\n",
				"4. Executing a SQL query\n",
				"5. (If Time Permits) Generating computed columns\n",
				" \n",
				"## Familiarization\n",
				"From the lab bucket, download and review weather.csv in a text editor. This file contains real temperature and precipitation measurements for every day in Bergen in 2019 (spoiler alert, it was wet). All weather measurements are from Yr, delivered by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and NRK. \n",
				"\n",
				"The CSV file has 365 rows, containing the data for every day from 1 January to 31 December. Each row has 4 values:\n",
				"* The first value indicates the day number in a month (notice how this value wraps from 31 back to 1 as we move from January to February, for example).\n",
				"* The next value contains the minimum temperature for a day, in degrees Celsius.\n",
				"* The next value contains the maximum temperature for a day, in degrees Celsius.\n",
				"* The final value contains the precipitation for a day, in mm.\n",
				" \n",
				"## Part 1: Reading data from a CSV file into a DataFrame\n",
				"In the below code block add code to read data from weather.csv into a Spark SQL DataFrame object in memory. It’s similar to how you read JSON (see the PowerPoint chapter for a reminder), except you call the csv() method instead:\n",

				"\n",
				"In order to read this file into a DataFrame, you have to specify a couple of options to PySpark:\n",
				"* You need to tell PySpark to expect the header line.\n",
				"* You need to tell PySpark that the field delimiter is a semi-colon rather than a comma.\n",
				"\n",
				"This is how you specify options when reading a CSV file: \n",
