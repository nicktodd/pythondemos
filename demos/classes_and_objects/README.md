# Classes and Objects Demos

This folder contains Python demonstrations of key object-oriented programming concepts using BankAccount examples.

## Files

- `basic_class.py`: Demonstrates a basic class with instance variables and methods
- `static_methods.py`: Shows static methods and class methods
- `operator_overloading.py`: Illustrates overloading operators like +, -, ==, etc.
- `str_repr.py`: Demonstrates `__str__` and `__repr__` methods for string representations
- `inheritance.py`: Shows single inheritance with a SavingsAccount subclass
- `multiple_inheritance.py`: Demonstrates multiple inheritance with a PremiumAccount class
- `run_demos.py`: Instructions on how to run each demo

## How to Run

Each demo file can be run independently:

```bash
python basic_class.py
python static_methods.py
# etc.
```

Or run `python run_demos.py` to see the instructions.

## Concepts Covered

1. **Basic Classes**: Creating classes, instance variables, methods
2. **Static and Class Methods**: Utility functions and alternative constructors
3. **Operator Overloading**: Making objects work with Python operators
4. **String Representations**: User-friendly vs. developer representations
5. **Inheritance**: Code reuse through subclassing
6. **Multiple Inheritance**: Inheriting from multiple base classes

All examples include detailed comments explaining the code and concepts.
