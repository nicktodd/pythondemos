    "# Why use an API ?\n",
    "Why use an API instead of a static CSV dataset you can download from the web? (which can also be automated)\n",
    "APIs are useful in the following cases:\n",
    "- **The data is changing quickly**. An example of this is stock price data. It doesn’t really make sense to regenerate a dataset and download it every minute — this will take a lot of bandwidth, and be pretty slow.\n",
    "- **You want a small piece of a much larger set of data**. Reddit comments are one example. What if you want to just pull your own comments on Reddit? It doesn’t make much sense to download the entire Reddit database, then filter just your own comments.\n",
    "- **There is repeated computation involved**. Spotify has an API that can tell you the genre of a piece of music. You could theoretically create your own classifier, and use it to compute music categories, but you’ll never have as much data as Spotify does.\n"

    "# API Status Codes\n",
    "Status codes are returned with every request that is made to a web server. Status codes indicate information about what happened with a request. Here are some codes that are relevant to GET requests:\n",
    "- 200: Everything went okay, and the result has been returned (if any).\n",
    "- 301: The server is redirecting you to a different endpoint. This can happen when a company switches domain names, or an endpoint name is changed.\n",
    "- 400: The server thinks you made a bad request. This can happen when you don’t send along the right data, among other things.\n",
    "- 401: The server thinks you’re not authenticated. Many APIs require login ccredentials, so this happens when you don’t send the right credentials to access an API.\n",
    "- 403: The resource you’re trying to access is forbidden: you don’t have the right permissions to see it.\n",
    "- 404: The resource you tried to access wasn’t found on the server.\n",
    "- 503: The server is not ready to handle the request.\n",
    "You might notice that all of the status codes that begin with a ‘4’ indicate some sort of error. The first number of status codes indicate their categorization. This is useful — you can know that if your status code starts with a ‘2’ it was successful and if it starts with a ‘4’ or ‘5’ there was an error.
