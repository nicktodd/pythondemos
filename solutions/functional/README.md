# Functional Programming Solutions

This folder contains complete solution files for the Python Functional Programming lab.

## Files

- `first_class_functions.py` - Complete implementation of functions as first-class citizens
- `lambda_exercises.py` - Complete implementation of lambda functions
- `map_filter_reduce_exercises.py` - Complete implementation of map, filter, reduce
- `comprehensions_exercises.py` - Complete implementation of list comprehensions
- `generator_exercises.py` - Complete implementation of generators
- `recursion_exercises.py` - Complete implementation of recursion
- `pure_functions_exercises.py` - Complete implementation of pure functions
- `decorator_exercises.py` - Complete implementation of decorators

## Instructions

1. Use these files to check your implementations in `labs/functional/`
2. Compare your code with the solutions after completing each exercise
3. Run the test code to verify the implementations work correctly
4. Study the solutions to learn different approaches and best practices

## Tips

- Don't look at the solutions until you've attempted the exercises yourself
- Compare your approach with the solution to see if there are more efficient or elegant ways
- Use these as references for future functional programming projects
