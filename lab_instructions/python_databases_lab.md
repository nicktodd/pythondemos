## Accessing Compact Discs Table with Python Script Exercise

In this exercise, you will write a Python script to access and manipulate the `compact_discs` table in the existing MySQL database. Follow the steps below to complete the exercise.

### Prerequisites

Before starting the exercise, ensure that you have the following:

- Python installed on your machine
- The mysql-connector-python package installed

### Step 1: Setting Up the Project

1. Create a new folder on your machine for the exercise.
2. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code).
3. Create a new Python script file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `access_compact_discs.py`).

### Step 2: Importing Required Modules

1. At the beginning of the script, import the necessary modules:
   ```python
   import mysql.connector
   ```

### Step 3: Connecting to the MySQL Database

1. In the script, establish a connection to the MySQL database:
   ```python
   db = mysql.connector.connect(
       host="localhost",
       user="root",
       password="c0nygre",
       database="conygre"
   )
   ```

### Step 4: Retrieving Compact Discs

1. Execute a SELECT query to retrieve all compact discs from the `compact_discs` table:
   ```python
   query = "SELECT * FROM compact_discs"

   cursor = db.cursor()
   cursor.execute(query)

   result = cursor.fetchall()
   ```
   This retrieves all records from the `compact_discs` table and stores them in the `result` variable.

2. Print the retrieved compact discs:
   ```python
   print("Retrieved Compact Discs:")
   for cd in result:
       print(cd)
   ```

### Step 5: Testing the Retrieval

1. Run the script to test the retrieval functionality.
2. Ensure that the compact discs are printed correctly.

### Step 6: Updating a Compact Disc

1. Execute an UPDATE query to modify a specific compact disc in the `compact_discs` table:
   ```python
   query = "UPDATE compact_discs SET title = 'New Title' WHERE id = 10"

   cursor = db.cursor()
   cursor.execute(query)
   db.commit()
   ```
   This updates the `title` column of the compact disc with `id` equal to 10.

### Step 7: Testing the Update

1. Run the script to test the update functionality.
2. Retrieve the compact disc with `id` equal to 1.
3. Verify that the title has been updated to 'New Title'.

### Step 8: Deleting a Compact Disc

1. Execute a DELETE query to remove a specific compact disc from the `compact_discs` table:
   ```python
   query = "DELETE FROM compact_discs WHERE id = 10"

   cursor = db.cursor()
   cursor.execute(query)
   db.commit()
   ```
   This deletes the compact disc with `id` equal to 10 from the table.

### Step 9: Testing the Deletion

1. Run the script to test the delete functionality.
2. Attempt to retrieve the compact disc with `id` equal to 10.
3. Verify that no record is returned.

### Step 10: Inserting a New Compact Disc

1. Execute an INSERT query to add a new compact disc to the `compact_discs` table:

```python
   query = "INSERT INTO compact_discs (title, artist, price, tracks) VALUES ('New Disc', 'New Artist', 12.99, 10)"

   cursor = db.cursor()
   cursor.execute(query)
   db.commit()
   ```

This inserts a new record into the table.

### Step 11: Testing the Insertion

1. Run the script to test the insert functionality.
2. Retrieve all the compact discs .
3. Verify that the inserted record is returned.
